## Agriculture Supply Chain Implementation using Blockchain

This project uses blockchain technology to create an agriculture supply chain solution. Consumers can trace their food products back to the source using smart contracts written in Solidity.

### Main Features:

-  Farmers can create contracts by listing agriculture products on the site.
-  Processors can purchase products from farmers.
-  Distributors can buy from processors.
-  Retailers can purchase from distributors.
-  Consumers can track the products from retailers.
-  Admin panel for managing and listing all actors (farmers, processors, distributors, retailers).
-  QR codes enable tracking of products from farm to fork by analyzing transactions on the smart contracts.
